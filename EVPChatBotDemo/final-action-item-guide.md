# Comprehensive Action Item Guide for U.S. Property Market Chatbot Prototype

## Day 1: Setup and API Access (Estimated time: 4-6 hours)

1. Zillow API Key Acquisition (2-3 hours)
   a. Visit https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm
   b. Sign up for a Zillow account if you don't have one
   c. Navigate to the API registration page
   d. Fill out the application form:
      - Specify the project as "Property Valuation Chatbot Prototype"
      - Describe intended use: "Developing a chatbot to provide property valuations and market insights"
   e. Submit the application and wait for approval (may take a few hours to a day)
   f. Once approved, locate and copy your Zillow API key

   Troubleshooting: If approval is delayed, prepare to use mock data for initial development. Create a fallback plan using publicly available property data.

2. Development Environment Setup (1-2 hours)
   a. Install Python 3.8 or later if not already installed
   b. Open a terminal or command prompt
   c. Create a new directory for the project:
      ```
      mkdir us_property_chatbot
      cd us_property_chatbot
      ```
   d. Create a new Python virtual environment:
      ```
      python -m venv venv
      ```
   e. Activate the virtual environment:
      - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
      - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
   f. Install required libraries:
      ```
      pip install requests python-dotenv
      ```

3. API Key Security Setup (30 minutes)
   a. In the project root directory, create a file named `.env`
   b. Open the `.env` file in a text editor
   c. Add your Zillow API key:
      ```
      ZILLOW_API_KEY=your_zillow_api_key_here
      ```
   d. Save and close the file
   e. Create a `.gitignore` file (if using git) and add `.env` to it to prevent accidental exposure of your API key

## Day 2: Data Preparation and Initial Testing (Estimated time: 6-8 hours)

4. Populate Q&A Dictionary (3-4 hours)
   a. Create a new file named `qa_data.py`
   b. Open `qa_data.py` in your preferred code editor
   c. Create a dictionary named `qa_dict`
   d. Research common real estate questions and their answers
   e. Add at least 20 question-answer pairs to `qa_dict`, for example:
      ```python
      qa_dict = {
          "What is a mortgage?": "A mortgage is a loan used to purchase a home...",
          "How do I improve my credit score?": "To improve your credit score, you can...",
          # Add more Q&A pairs here
      }
      ```

5. Prepare Test Data (1-2 hours)
   a. Create a file named `test_data.py`
   b. Add a list of at least 10 diverse property addresses for testing, e.g.:
      ```python
      test_addresses = [
          ("123 Main St", "Anytown, CA 12345"),
          ("456 Elm St", "Springfield, IL 67890"),
          # Add more addresses here
      ]
      ```
   c. Include a variety of property types and locations

6. Initial Zillow API Testing (2 hours)
   a. Create a file named `zillow_api_test.py`
   b. Implement a basic function to test the Zillow API:
      ```python
      import os
      from dotenv import load_dotenv
      import requests

      load_dotenv()
      ZILLOW_API_KEY = os.getenv('ZILLOW_API_KEY')

      def test_zillow_api(address, citystatezip):
          base_url = "http://www.zillow.com/webservice/GetSearchResults.htm"
          params = {
              'zws-id': ZILLOW_API_KEY,
              'address': address,
              'citystatezip': citystatezip
          }
          response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
          print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
          print(f"Response Content: {response.text}")

      # Test with a sample address
      test_zillow_api("2114 Bigelow Ave", "Seattle, WA")
      ```
   c. Run the test script and verify that you receive a valid response
   d. Troubleshoot any issues (e.g., API key problems, network errors)

## Day 3-4: Core Development (Estimated time: 16-20 hours)

7. Implement Core Chatbot Functionality (8-10 hours)
   a. Create the main chatbot script as outlined in the previous response
   b. Implement the Zillow API integration with rate limiting
   c. Develop the AutoVal form filling feature
   d. Create the property comparison functionality

8. Continuous Testing (throughout development)
   a. Test each feature as it's developed
   b. Use the prepared test data to verify Zillow API integration
   c. Simulate user interactions to test the AutoVal form filling
   d. Verify property comparison functionality with different address pairs

## Day 5: Refinement and Error Handling (Estimated time: 6-8 hours)

9. Implement Error Handling and Edge Cases (3-4 hours)
   a. Add try-except blocks for API calls and data processing
   b. Implement graceful error messages for users
   c. Handle potential missing data in API responses

10. Refine Conversation Flow (3-4 hours)
    a. Improve the chatbot's responses for clarity and engagement
    b. Implement the help command functionality
    c. Add the feedback collection feature

## Day 6: Documentation and Final Testing (Estimated time: 6-8 hours)

11. Create Documentation (3-4 hours)

12. Comprehensive Testing (3-4 hours)
    a. Develop a test script covering all chatbot functionalities
    b. Run through various user scenarios, including edge cases
    c. Document any bugs or issues found for future improvement

## Day 7: Demo Preparation and Team Briefing (Estimated time: 4-6 hours)

13. Prepare Demo Script (2-3 hours)
    a. Identify key features to showcase
    b. Create a sequence of user inputs demonstrating all functionalities
    c. Prepare talking points highlighting the chatbot's capabilities

14. Team Briefing and Dry Run (2-3 hours)
    a. Schedule a team meeting
    b. Walk through the chatbot's features and demo script
    c. Assign roles for the demo if applicable (e.g., who will type inputs, who will explain features)
    d. Conduct a dry run of the demo, timing each section

15. Final Adjustments
    a. Make any last-minute tweaks based on the dry run
    b. Ensure all team members are comfortable with their roles
    c. Double-check that the development environment is stable and ready for the demo

Throughout the week:
- Regularly commit your code if using version control
- Keep a log of any challenges faced and how they were overcome
- Be prepared to explain design decisions and future improvement plans during the demo

By following this detailed guide, you'll be well-prepared to develop, test, and demonstrate your U.S. Property Market Chatbot prototype within the one-week timeframe. Remember to stay flexible and be ready to adapt if you encounter unexpected challenges. Good luck with your project!
